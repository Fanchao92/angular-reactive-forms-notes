FormGroup and FormControl are the 2 classes for model-driven forms.
These 2 classes contain the info about user input such as pristine/dirty, valid/error, touched/untouched.

Formcontrol tracks an individual user input element (text, radio button, select).
Formgroup tracks the state of a group of input elements as a whole. Formgroups can be nested.

In Reactive form design pattern, a form model is a data structure that respresents the HTML form. It tracks the user input values, as well as form state.
We first need to create a form model in the component, and then bind form input elements to our form model.
A form model needs at least one FormGroup. A FormControl is defined for each input element.
